# Ada Chess Project written in Python

# 1. Challenge Outline

### A. Summary and review of the proplem.

I am creating a Chess Game using Python as the programming language, 
I will be building a stardard version focusing on creating a simple 
version of Chess that will acknowledge when a player is in checkmate 
or that both players are in a stalemate. I will be trying to incorperate 
as many of the best coding practices. The original release and submitted 
version will involve a menu that allows you to select a new game. 
In future releases, player vs computer functionality will be implemented 
as well as more unique, unkniwn rules such as the 'En Passant' and 'Casteling'. 
I would also be improving the algoryths so the program may be able to think more 
than one step ahead to show the user the best moves as opposed to all possible moves.

### C. Initial working plan, overall approach, development strategy and approach to quality

When I began to design the Chess Game I started with a very basic idea of what a 
game should look like and as can be seen by my commits I had many trial and errors. 
when decideing or an approach that would better structure the game I decided to use 
MVC, Model, View and Controller. This better organises the code and make it easier to 
make changes and updates and helps to create clean code with better organisation. The 
view handle the the graphical display such as the the highlighted moves as well as 
loading the images of the pieces. The model contains the the main methods such as the 
the games working out all possible moves, the method that works out if a square is under 
attack and if the potential move is into a valid square. Finally the Controller contains
the the "control logic" it takes the users choice and then sends it to the model and 
then waits for the response to send back to the view e.g after a player moves into a 
checkmate position the response from the model will inform the view that the user has 
indeed created a checkmate.
        
My initial plan was to create a file that would take advantage of the libary pygame to 
draw the board and load the images. I decided that I would try and split the chess logic 
and graphics in seperate folders as to keep them seperate and less conviluted than a one 
file project. I was following the kamban board I created quite ridgedly at first however 
due to my lack of focus on design I began to create two files that became more and more 
convulted due to the lack of a design approach.

I attempted to use an agile approach and wanted to create the game in sprints, this however 
started to become unreasonable due to the time constraint and so created mini sprints in the 
form of user stories. I also tries to work in the 'red', 'green', 'refactor' style however 
I amended it to 'code', 'refactor'. This was mainly due to the fact that I was testing the 
game through user testing and print(). as opposed to writting tests that fail, writting the 
logic to make them pass and then refactoring that code. Combining both would have been a 
much better approach and it is deffinantly something I would consider in future., 
I will disscuss this in more detail below.

### D. Analysis and decomposition of the overall problem into key ‘epic’ style tasks

I used the website Trello to plan the user stories out. I didn't plan an epic story within the 
Trello board as I was working on this as a solo project and overlooked this detail. Reflecting on
this I would deffinatly wirte the epic story down as if I were to move forward with this project 
in the months to come I might remember the exact context in which I was planning out this game i.e
did I want a highly sophisticated chess game or whether it should be more of a simple game. I still 
have tickets in the 'TODO' list as I have more ideas on how to improve the code as well as add more
features to the game and I will explain this furthur in a later section. I added extra detail when needed
and as you can tell by the trello board, as referenced earlier, I still have improvements to make which I 
consider 'Nice to have' but not integeral to the finished product to be submitted.

### E. Initial object-oriented design ideas and planned phased breakdown into smaller tasks

One of the main reasons I wanted to incorperate a 'code, refactor' style of coding is to create flexible , 
maintainable and testable code. This is achieveable using the object oriented design and by making use of 
technologies such as Trello I was able to break down user stories into manageable tasks. I made use of many 
OO princeples while designing this game such as Abstraction, Overriding, Encapsulation and creating classes 
and object I will get into more detail later on but these techniques alow me to create good clean code that 
can be taken on by another with relative ease.

I have crteated classes where appropriate such as the Move class which is more important for a specific 
task i.e to create the moveId which helps track with the movement of each piece, which I will go into 
more detail later on. However, I have taken advantage of other techniques than classes i.e the use of the 
dictionarty I chose to create a dictionary as I thought creating a class as a way to avoid an if statement was 
'overkill' and so used a dictionary instaed. 

When creating functions for the game I always looked at creating checks to monitor each user input was within 
the realms of what I wanted them to be able to do. I therefore added checks that made sure they couldn't do moves 
such as move 'out of bounds' to interact with pieces on the opposite side as can be seen on line 38 of the 
gameController.py. I would like to add some try catches into the project and write refactor some code to be more 
defensive however I felt that this was out of the scope of the project and intial goal and creating a working minimum 
viable product.

# 2. Development

### A. Adoption and use of ‘good’ standards

When it comes to 'good' standards I endevored to make use of the DRY (don't repeat yourself) this can be 
clearly shown in my getQueenMove method. AS the Queen can only move in the direction of a rook or bishop 
I was able to use the rook and bishop move methods to create the queen move method which not only saved 
time but also allowed me to stick to the DRY principle which I felt helped stick to the 'good' coding standards. 

I also made sure to indent whilst designing functions to show the scope of where each function was being 
called which would have helped with things like promises if I had needed them. It also allows reviewers to see 
the beginning and end of control structures. I also tried to avoid deep nesting as much as possible which meant
I would only go a max of a nested if/for of 4 this, although not great allowed me to set a target and helped me
create less convaluted code that can be easily read and easily maintanable.

### B. Phase 1 development: tasks, code review and changes

After each ticket I would look to see if if the code could be refactored to look more readable. 
As I was using Python, that is known for its readability I focused on trying to crate pure functions 
such as the isValidSquare function as well as the move methods i.e getPawnMove. Pure function allow 
for the code to be easily refactored without impacting on dependant functions/classes. When designing 
any function or class at work we have many policies we follow and one is to create, as best you can, 
self containing functions that interact with the code base but that could be refactored without effecting 
other things that might impact on live costing time and money. This project although non-comercial should 
get the same level of professionalism. Rather than creating seperate tickets for the refactoring process 
I would then move tickets back to the doing list when I was refactoring that code. This, although
successful I believe would have been confusing if I was working with other developers and therfore if I  
were to do this again I would have created seperate tickets for each refactor. By refactoring after each ticket
I was able to to engage in constant code reviews which kept me trying to keep building my app with the original 
design in the forefront of my mind.
    
An example of my refactoring would be this: 
![RefactorExample](assets/refactorExample.png)

The original code 'move in validMoves' checks if 'move' is present in a list of 'validMoves'. Even though this
code was functional for its purpose it still needed to search the entire list to find the 'move'. With small 
static lists this may be perfectly fine however if this list was to get larger for whatever reason it can be 
time consuming and inefficient especially if it needs to be performed multiple times.
By creating a loop I was able to reduce some of the complexity, in the worst situation it would take the same 
amount of time to complete. However by searching the list until it has found the 'move' it is looking for it will 
exit the loop and save computing time therefore the more efficient way of coding.

### C. Ensuring quality through testing and resolving bugs.

I firstly took advantage or the print machanic in python which allowed me to check if I was getting the disiered 
results and whether the variables I was creating, was being properly passed and handled. e.g: 
![Alt text](assets/printEvidence.png)

The example above shows a small example of this process. I wanted to create a proper notaion so that 
I could clearly see the move of the piece. this was important and I wanted to make sure the movement 
reresented on screen matched the computations behind the screen. I created a notation so each move 
would show the proper move from the square location moved from to the square location the piece moves to. 
Changed the oreder of the board to start from 1 and not the ordinal number of 0. 
using print I was able to see this change not only work but provide data that my visuals were not only 
working but were matching the desiered computaional outcome.

For the debugging I was able to set breakpoints at specific lines where you suspect there might be issues. VS Code 
will run in debugging mode and I was able to select the python environment option as to make it more specific to my 
needs. While debugging, I could inspect the values of variables by hovering the mouse over them, 
or I could add them to the "Watch" panel to monitor their values throughout the debugging session. I was able 
to step over or into various code which allowed me to inspect suspected bugs one line at a time. If you reach 
a point where you believe the code is working correctly, you can continue execution. Using VS Code's debugging 
tools in this way allowed me to systematically identify and resolve issues within the Chess Game code, ensuring 
a smoother and error-free gaming experience. This was helpful when assesing if variables where containing the correct information. 
One of the issues I ran into was during the 'getValidMove' function:

![ValidMoveFunctionPic](assets/validMoveFunction.png)
#
Through the use of debugging is was able to step into the function I was having an isse with and find that due to 
a poor design I had to add duplicate code in the form of the 'whiteToMove' variable/flag. due to the extra functionality
such as checking if the moke created a check, checkmate or stalemate I had to make sure that after a move was made it 
remained the users turn until the function could check if it matched any of the aforementioned game states. I had to 
make sure that each time there was a natural changing of turns i.e after the 'makeMove' function I switched the turns
back for a final check on the state of play.

# 3. Evaluation

### A1 . Code Refactoring

In my MVC Chess project, I applied effective code refactoring techniques to improve the overall code design, 
readability, and maintainability. One key example of code refactoring was the use of a dictionary 
(self.moveFunctions) to map each piece type to its corresponding move function. This approach made the 
getValidMoves() method more concise and easier to manage, as it centralised the piece-specific move logic 
in separate methods. 
Another successful refactoring was the use of dictionary comprehensions to create rowsToRanks and colsToFiles, 
which efficiently mapped rank and file values between the board representation and chess notation. 
These refactoring strategies greatly enhanced the clarity and modularity of my code.

### A2 .Code Reuse

Throughout the MVC Chess project, I endevoured to reuse code helping minimise redundancy and improve efficiency. 
For instance, I implemented methods like getRookMoves() and getBishopMoves() to calculate legal moves for 
both the rook and bishop pieces. 
Reusing these methods in the getQueenMoves() showcased effective code reuse by using the functionalities 
of both rook and bishop moves. 

![queenMovePic](assets/queenMove.png)

Additionally, the makeMove() and undoMove() methods were designed to be universally applicable for any chess piece, 
further enhancing code reuse. By reusing these functions, my code became more streamlined and maintainable, 
contributing to the overall robustness of the project.

### A3 . Code Smells

As a developer working on the MVC Chess project, I find code quality and maintainability crucial for 
the success of the application. To ensure these aspects, I rely on various tools, with Pylint being a 
key asset in my arsenal. Pylint, a powerful static code analysis tool, helps me identify potential code 
smells, enforce adherence to the PEP 8 style guide, and maintain consistency throughout the project.
By incorporating Pylint and following its recommendations in the MVC Chess project, I can confidently 
identify and address potential code smells, ensuring that the codebase remains clean, maintainable, and 
adheres to the good codeing practices I mentioned earlier.

### B. Advanced programming principles

One of the programmin principles I used quite frequently is encapsulation, The 'GameController' 
class encapsulates the game logic and control flow. It abstracts the interactions between the 
model and view, allowing them to communicate through its methods:

![Encapsulation example](assets/encapsulation.png)

When it comes to abstraction the GameModel class exhibits abstraction by providing separate methods 
for each piece's movement logic, abstracting away the complexities. Abstraction involves hiding 
implementation details and presenting only relevant information to the user which is demonstarted
here:

![Abstraction example](assets/abstraction.png)

I have the Move class representing a chess move. The 'GameModel' class has different 
methods like getBishopMoves, getRookMoves, 'getQueenMoves', and 'getKingMoves', each handling moves specific 
to a particular piece. However, when generating all possible valid moves, I use the 'getAllPossibleMoves' 
method, which, thanks to polymorphism, uniformly invokes the relevant move methods based on the piece being 
considered:

![polymorphism example](assets/polymorphism.png)

### Features showcase and embedded innovations

In my chess game code project, I have implemented several key features and innovative functionalities 
to create an engaging and user-friendly experience. One notable feature is the Model,View and Controller, 
which creates a separation of concerns and enhances code organization. This design 
pattern allows me to easily manage the game's logic (Model), user interface (View), and user input 
handling (Controller). 

Furthermore, I have utilized object-oriented programming (OOP) to encapsulate data and behavior 
within classes, as mentioned earlier. This OOP approach promotes code reusability and extensibility. 
An excellent example of this is the use of polymorphism to calculate valid moves for each piece type. 
The 'getAllPossibleMoves' method dynamically dispatches the move calculation to the specific piece's 
move function

Another standout feature is the implementation of an undo functionality. Players can undo their 
moves by invoking the undoMove method in the GameModel class. This innovation leverages a stack-like 
mechanism, allowing players to revert their last move and provides a safeguard against accidental mistakes. 
The undo feature enhances user experience and showcases the power of Python's list operations to manage 
move history efficiently.

![undo function](assets/undoFunction.png)

Additionally, I have incorporated a graphical user interface using the Pygame library. 
The GameView class renders the chessboard and pieces on the screen, creating an intuitive and 
visually appealing interface. Players can interact with the board through mouse clicks, and 
highlighted squares display valid moves when selecting a piece. This GUI enriches the gaming
experience and provides players with a user-friendly platform to enjoy the game.

![Pygame Example](assets/pygameExample.png)

These features collectively highlight the best aspects of my code, ensuring a comprehensive and 
enjoyable chess game.


### Improved algorithms – research, design, implementation, and tested confirmation.

When designing the game I spent very little time on the structure and more on getting a working app. 
This became a big issue as my code was, although functional, was challenging to manage and maintain.
When I finally refactored the code to the MVC architecture, The Gamestate class now serves as the Model, 
responsible for storing the current state of the chess game and determining valid moves. The index.py 
file handles the View and Controller aspects, taking care of user input, graphical display, and 
coordinating with the Gamestate model.

Before MVC:

![Previous Design](assets/previousDesign.png)


And Now:

![MVC Example](assets/MVCPic.png)

Through my research I found dictionaries and as I have shown throughout this read me I make use of one to 
avoid very long if statements. This dictionary make my code more readable and easier to manage.

My initial Idea:

if (turn == "w" and self.whiteToMove) or (turn == "b" and not self.whiteToMove):
                    piece = self.board[row][col][1]
                    if piece == "P":
                        self.getPawnMoves(row, col, moves)
                    elif piece == "R":
                        self.getRookMoves(row, col, moves)
                    elif piece == "N":
                        self.getKnightMoves(row, col, moves)
                    elif piece == "B":
                        self.getBishopMoves(row, col, moves)
                    elif piece == "Q":
                        self.getQueenMoves(row, col, moves)
                    elif piece == "K":
                        self.getKingMoves(row, col, moves)

this, although functionable would have took up unnecessary space and if I was to continue in this mindset I 
may have created something unreadable and unmanageable. However, after finding the dictionary feature
I decided to use that instead. 

Dictionary:

![dictionary](assets/dictionary.png)

### Reflective review, opportunities to improve and continued professional development.

On reflection, one strength of my code lies in its efficient use of dictionaries to represent the chess pieces and 
their movements. By mapping each piece to its corresponding move function, the code becomes concise and 
readable, example can be seen above. Additionally, the code demonstrates good use of conditional statements and 
loops to handle valid moves and game rules. For instance, the 'getValidMoves' method effectively generates all 
possible moves and filters out illegal moves by considering the opponent's moves and potential checks on the king.

As demonstrated here:

![getValidMoves](assets/validMoveFunction.png)

![inCheck&squareUnderAttack](assets/squareUnderAttack.png)

The code also features a simple yet functional graphical user interface using the Pygame library. 
The 'GameView' class effectively loads chess piece images, draws the chessboard, highlights squares, and 
updates the display. The implementation of the menu system (GameMenu) further enhances the user experience, 
allowing users to start a new game or quit the application.

![menu](assets/menu.png)

When it comes to improvements I feel although my documentation is helpful it is still lacking and and the 
code could benifit from enhanced code documentation to help with its readability for both current developers 
and any future developers should there be any.

I would also look to incorperate type hints into my project, as can be seen in the python documentation 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html. Type hints would provide more clarity on function arguments and 
return types, assisting in code maintenance and reducing the chances of bugs caused by type-related issues.

For professional development, I would consider refactoring the codebase to conform to a more consistent coding 
style, following popular Python style guides like PEP 8, examples can be found here: 
https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/. When I am working we follow the psr-12 (https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) 
guidelines as well as others such as doctrine (https://github.com/doctrine/coding-standard). Using these coding 
standards not only do we manage to keep every member of the company coding in the same way but it makes it 
easier to share tasks if everyone is deigning in a similar way. This makes refactoring and reading of code 
easier than if we allowed each developer to write using there own coding standards. 

To challenge myself further, I could explore additional chess features, such as castling, en passant. I would 
look at my current pawn promotion structure and make it possible for the user to pick which piece they would 
like to promote thier pawn to as opposed to defaulting them to the most efficient choice. 

![Pawn Promotion Flag](assets/pawnPromotionFlag.png)
![Pawn Promotion](assets/pawnPromotion.png)


Additionally, I would seek opportunities to optimize the code for better performance. Profiling the 
code and identifying bottlenecks would allow me to make targeted optimizations, resulting in a more 
responsive and efficient chess engine.

I would then look to add an AI component to my game which would allow me to create a PvE version of my game.
This would require further tuning of my 'allPossibleMoves' function to allow the AI to think multiple steps 
ahead instead of the one my current computations allow. I would like to incorperate websockets into the project 
to allow for multiplayer across different machines.

Given the time this could also be refactored to support 4d chess allowing for myself or another coder to experiment
more with the borders of the chess board which I have, at the moment have the game monitoring and blocking pieces from
moving beyond.

Using the OOP's as well as the MVC architecture I have created a great platform from which to take this
project to the 'next level' and with the seperation of concerns I have attemped to create I belive that 
improvements of a small nature or a bigger overhaul refactor would be easy to achieve.
