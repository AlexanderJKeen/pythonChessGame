# Ada Chess Project written in Python

# Challenge Outline

### A. Summary and review of the proplem.

    I am creating a Chess Game using Python as the programming language, 
    I will be building a stardard version focusing on creating a simple 
    version of Chess that will acknowledge when a player is in checkmate 
    or that both players are in a stalemate. I will be trying to incorperate 
    as many of the best coding practices. The original release and submitted 
    version will involve a menu that allows you to select a new game. 
    In future releases, player vs computer functionality will be implemented 
    as well as more unique, unkniwn rules such as the 'En Passant' and 'Casteling'. 
    I would also be improving the algoryths so the program may be able to think more 
    than one step ahead to show the user the best moves as opposed to all possible moves.
